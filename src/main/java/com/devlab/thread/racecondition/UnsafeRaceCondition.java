/*

The Problem â€” Race Condition

A race condition happens when multiple threads try to read and modify the same variable at the same time.

Letâ€™s visualize what happens in the CPU:

Thread 1:

Reads count (say count = 5)

Adds 1 â†’ (5 + 1 = 6)

Writes 6 back

Thread 2 (at the same time):

Reads count (still sees 5)

Adds 1 â†’ (5 + 1 = 6)

Writes 6 back

Result? Both thought count was 5, and both wrote 6.
ðŸ‘‰ One update got lost.

Thatâ€™s why you see smaller numbers â€” data corruption due to concurrency.
